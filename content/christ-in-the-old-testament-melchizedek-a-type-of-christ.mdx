When many people read the Old Testament, it is often viewed as a collection of ancient laws and historical narratives. Yet Jesus Himself taught that the Scriptures testify of Him. “Beginning at Moses and all the Prophets,” He explained the things concerning Himself (Luke 24:27). The Old Testament is not separate from the gospel but is the foundation upon which it stands.

From the moment humanity fell, God revealed His redemptive purpose. In Genesis 3:15, the Lord promised that the seed of the woman would crush the serpent’s head. From that point forward, Scripture moves steadily toward the coming of Christ. Every covenant, sacrifice, and priestly system prepares the way for a perfect Redeemer.

One of the clearest and most fascinating foreshadows of Christ is found in the figure of Melchizedek.

## Seeing Christ in the Old Testament

Christ is revealed in the Old Testament in several ways. Sometimes He appears through direct prophecy. At other times He is present through divine patterns, people, events, and institutions that anticipate His person and work. The apostle Paul explains that these things were “a shadow of things to come, but the substance is of Christ” (Colossians 2:17).

Melchizedek is one of these God designed shadows.

## The Appearance of Melchizedek

Melchizedek first appears in Genesis 14 following Abraham’s victory in battle:

> Then Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine; he was the priest of God Most High. And he blessed him… (Genesis 14:18 to 19).

His name, Malki-tsedeq(Hebrew), means king of righteousness, and he ruled over Salem meaning peace. From the very beginning, he embodies both righteousness and peace.

Abraham responds by giving him a tithe of all (Genesis 14:20). Hebrews later explains the significance of this moment: “Now beyond all contradiction the lesser is blessed by the better” (Hebrews 7:7). By blessing Abraham, Melchizedek is presented as spiritually greater than Israel’s patriarch.

## God’s Oath in Psalm 110

Hundreds of years later, King David prophesied concerning the Messiah:

> The Lord has sworn and will not relent, ‘You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek’ (Psalm 110:4).

This verse is foundational to understanding Christ’s priesthood. Israel already had priests from the sons of Aaron, yet God declared that the Messiah would arise from a different order entirely. This priesthood would not be temporary or based on genealogy but eternal and established by divine oath.

The New Testament repeatedly identifies Jesus as the fulfillment of this promise (Hebrews 5:6 and Hebrews 7:17).

## The Limitations of the Aaronic Priesthood

The Aaronic priesthood was given by God, yet it was never intended to be permanent. Priests were appointed by lineage, served only between certain ages (Numbers 8:23 to 25), and were subject to human weakness and death.

Hebrews explains that “there were many priests, because they were prevented by death from continuing” (Hebrews 7:23). Their sacrifices had to be offered repeatedly and could never completely remove sin (Hebrews 10:1 to 4).

The law revealed humanity’s need but could not provide the cure.

## A Greater Priesthood

Melchizedek’s priesthood stands in sharp contrast. Scripture records no genealogy for him, no father, mother, or recorded death. Hebrews explains this intentionally:

> Without father, without mother, without genealogy… remaining a priest continually (Hebrews 7:3).

This does not mean Melchizedek was eternal, but that his priesthood was presented as timeless, foreshadowing the eternal priesthood of Christ.

Unlike Aaron’s sons, Melchizedek was both king and priest, a union later forbidden under the Mosaic Law. Yet Scripture foretold that the Messiah would restore this union:

> He shall be a priest on His throne (Zechariah 6:13).

## Righteousness and Peace United

Melchizedek’s titles reveal gospel truth. He is first king of righteousness, then king of peace. Scripture teaches that peace with God can only follow righteousness before God.

Paul writes, “Being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ” (Romans 5:1). Earlier he explains that believers receive “the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ” (Romans 3:22).

Isaiah prophesied the same truth centuries earlier: “The work of righteousness will be peace” (Isaiah 32:17).

What Melchizedek symbolised, Christ fulfilled.

## Fulfilled in Jesus Christ

Jesus is the true King of Righteousness. He is the Prince of Peace (Isaiah 9:6). Though born from the tribe of Judah and not Levi, He was appointed High Priest by God Himself.

Hebrews declares:

> Such a High Priest was fitting for us… who has become higher than the heavens (Hebrews 7:26).

Unlike earthly priests, Jesus offered Himself once for all (Hebrews 9:12). Because He lives forever, “He has an unchangeable priesthood” and “is able to save to the uttermost those who come to God through Him” (Hebrews 7:24 to 25).

## Why This Matters Today

Because Christ’s priesthood is eternal, our salvation is secure when we are in Christ. We do not rely on repeated sacrifices, human mediators, or personal merit. We rely entirely on the finished work of Jesus Christ.

The same God who revealed His plan in Genesis brought it to completion at Calvary.

## Conclusion

Melchizedek stands as a quiet yet powerful witness in Scripture, pointing forward to a greater King and a greater Priest.
The Old Testament does not merely anticipate Christ. It testifies of Him. From Genesis to Revelation, God proclaims one message of redemption:
- Jesus Christ is our righteousness.
- Jesus Christ is our peace.
- Jesus Christ is our eternal High Priest.

> For of Him and through Him and to Him are all things, to whom be glory forever. (Romans 11:36)
